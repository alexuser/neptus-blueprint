##Project Purpose

Neptus is a non-profit, that seeks to spread as a student organization to universities around the world. Our Mission is to help non-profits Analyze Data to better Assess Impact. With our strong focus on Universities and students, we seek to build a solution to facilitate the process of getting into top universities, help students select major(s), classes, decals, frats, sororities, student groups, internships, and also bridge the gap between jobs and studies - so that employers can better assess who has spent their time on college productively, and so that high performing students from top universities can more readily get a job in the field they want to work in. At Cal, there are many solutions that help you pick classes once you already know what and how many majors you will take. But those who need to find themselves and their passion are underserved. Myself, I had a passion for computer science when I started my first degree in 1999. The problem is that by the time I finished in 2002, the work market was horrible. Nearly impossible to find a job. I had friend who had to write more than 100 applications before they got a job. Luckily, I had instead decided to continue studying for another degree in marketing, since I wanted to become an entrepreneur. A tool like this would prepare me long in advance that the job market had a downward trend, and that more students should seriously consider studying more. Neptus seek to become a recommendation engine for college students, suggesting which classes and major(s) you should take - considering what kind of job(s) you are looking to get.
